Open a terminal to verify that Node.js is installed properly:
`node -v`
`npm -v`

Weâ€™ll start by creating a new directory and an empty Node.js project.
`npm init --yes`

Add Cucumber as a development dependency:
`npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber`

# Run standalone
`npx cucumber-js`

the results will be:
